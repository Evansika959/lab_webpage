# AI-Powered EDA & Circuit Exploration

Overview for this section. Why we are doing this research? What are the challenges and opportunities?

## CircuitDNA

### Background

Power and heat have become the real bottlenecks: there is only so much heat we can dissipate. As a result, we cannot keep every core active at once, leaving a growing “dark silicon” region on the die. Elevated temperatures then compound the problem by accelerating aging and eroding long-term reliability.

In error-tolerant workloads, we can deliberately relax computation accuracy to cut power and area overhead. To navigate the trade-offs across accuracy, energy, and silicon cost, genetic algorithms are a natural fit for multi-objective design space exploration.
