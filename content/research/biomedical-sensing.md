## Sensor and Open-Source Silicon Chip for an Affordable and Robust Wearable Sensing System with Precise Temperature, Humidity, and Strain Sensing Capability [1][2]

We present the integration of the Laser-Induced-Graphene (LIG) sensors and the Analog Front-End (AFE) chip, all developed using open-source tools which facilitate an affordable prototyping for a multifunctional (temperature, humidity and strain) flexible wearable sensing system.
